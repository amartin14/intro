# Intro

This is just a simple git repo to mess around with if you want to start learning javascript.  It's easy to get started, and you'll learn faster than you think you will- and it's a ton of fun.

Start by forking this repo and then cloning down to your computer.

Make any changes you want and push them up using the following from the console:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "[Add commit message here]"
$ git push
```

Because the default branch is gh-pages, you can see any changes you push live at http://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/intro/


# Tutorials

Below are some links to various tutorials that I found helpful when I was getting started.

1. [CodeSchool](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) is a great resource, this one links to a basic intro to GitHub.
2. [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) is one of my favorites, easy to follow, step-by-step tutorials for several languages.
2. [Coderbyte](http://coderbyte.com/) is a good place to practice small toy-problems.
3. [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp) is a good resource for basic info.

There are a lot of other good resources out there too, check out [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) when you run into questions.
